# un-interactive-report

This is the code for an interactive performance report on the UN's progress towards becoming a "greener" organization. There are three interactive data visualizations, and other scrolling interactions built using javascript frameworks c3.js, d3.js, and scrollr.js. All relevant data* is loaded to the client-side as a csv file. All views are handled on the client-side with javascript and controlled by the user's interaction with dropdown filters for year, goal, and department. 

The data is not included in github due to the confidential nature of the report.
